## üåê Step 1: Deploy Backend (Railway - Recommended)

### Why Railway?
- Free tier available
- Easy GitHub integration
- Automatic deployments
- Built-in environment variables
- PostgreSQL database support

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Go to Railway.app**
   - Visit: https://railway.app
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository

3. **Configure Backend Deployment**
   - Select the `backend` folder
   - Railway will auto-detect it's a Node.js project

4. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3001
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically build and deploy
   - Note the generated URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)

## üé® Step 2: Deploy Frontend (Vercel)

### Why Vercel?
- Optimized for Next.js
- Free tier with excellent performance
- Automatic deployments
- Global CDN
- Easy domain management

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Go to Vercel.com**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Import Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Select the `frontend` folder

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Root Directory: `frontend`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`

4. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy automatically

## üîß Step 3: Update API URLs

After deployment, update your frontend to use the production backend URL:

1. **Update frontend/src/app/page.tsx**
   ```typescript
   // Replace all instances of 'http://localhost:3001' with your Railway URL
   const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'https://your-backend-url.railway.app';
   ```

2. **Update frontend/src/components/AppointmentForm.tsx**
   ```typescript
   // Update the fetch URL in fetchAvailableTimeSlots function
   const response = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/appointments/time-slots?doctorId=${doctorId}&date=${date}`);
   ```

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 4: Database Setup (Optional)

For production, you might want to add a real database:

### Option 1: Railway PostgreSQL
1. In your Railway project, add PostgreSQL service
2. Update backend to use the database connection
3. Add database migrations

### Option 2: Keep In-Memory (Current)
- Current system uses in-memory storage
- Data resets on server restart
- Good for demo/testing purposes

## üîê Step 5: Security Configuration

### Update JWT Secret
```bash
# Generate a strong JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Update CORS Settings
In `backend/src/main.ts`, update CORS:
```typescript
app.enableCors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app'
  ],
  methods: 'GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE',
  credentials: true,
});
```

## üì± Step 6: Test Production Deployment

### Test Checklist:
- [ ] Frontend loads correctly
- [ ] Login works with admin credentials
- [ ] Registration creates new users
- [ ] All CRUD operations work
- [ ] JWT tokens are generated and validated
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly

### Default Login Credentials:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

## üöÄ Step 7: Custom Domain (Optional)

### Vercel Custom Domain:
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Configure DNS settings

### Railway Custom Domain:
1. Go to your Railway project settings
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Configure DNS settings

## üìä Step 8: Monitoring & Analytics

### Vercel Analytics:
- Built-in analytics available
- Monitor page views and performance
- Track user interactions

### Railway Monitoring:
- Built-in logs and metrics
- Monitor API performance
- Track error rates

## üîÑ Step 9: Continuous Deployment

### Automatic Deployments:
- Both Vercel and Railway support automatic deployments
- Push to main branch triggers deployment
- Preview deployments for pull requests

### Environment Management:
- Use different branches for staging/production
- Environment-specific variables
- Automated testing before deployment

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**
   - Update CORS settings in backend
   - Ensure frontend URL is whitelisted

2. **API Connection Issues**
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify backend URL is correct
   - Check network connectivity

3. **Build Failures**
   - Check Node.js version compatibility
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check for TypeScript errors

4. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify JWT secret is set
   - Check token expiration settings
   - Ensure proper headers are sent

## üìã Final Deployment Checklist
